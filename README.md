# Ergonomics
A repository dedicated to ergonomics at your desk, from what I've researched online.

## Why ergonomics matter
If you are on GitHub, chances are you are reading this from a desk.
But do you know how to adjust it correctly? 

Ergonomics do matter. Poor ergonomics can lead to ackpain, carpal tunnel syndromes and many other health issues.
This repository wants to to make it as simple as possible for you to properly adjust your chair, desk, monitor and keyboard.
